# CSR-Racing-2
In order to make it easier for players to find cars, and the original catalog was bloated, I took the time to optimize the catalog. The cars in the cars folder were changed from the activity classification to the brand classification, so that the classification is clearer in structure.<br>
Quickly find car links →  https://git.io/JfApq  <br>

**Notes:**<br>
**Important updates**
1. From now on, the project starts to implement the membership subscription mode, members can access all the files in the project with a special password, which is valid for one month and needs to be renewed after the expiration to continue using.<br>
2. The membership price is $15 per month.<br>
3. All cars have been maximized. (Not including the plot car)<br>
4. The files are easily killed by antivirus software due to the encryption function, please join the whitelist to use. <br>
   Encryption service from: http://www.drmsoft.com/<br>
5. Open any encrypted file in the project and you will see the window prompt and machine ID.<br>
6. Please leave a message with your machine ID and email address when making payment, I will reply promptly with the membership password.
